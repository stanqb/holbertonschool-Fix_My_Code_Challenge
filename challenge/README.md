# Fix My Code Challenge

This project is a debugging challenge where you need to fix existing code implementations across different programming languages.

## Description

The challenge consists of fixing various code implementations that have bugs or incorrect behavior:

1. **FizzBuzz (Python)** - Fix the FizzBuzz implementation that doesn't handle the number 15 correctly
2. **Print Square (JavaScript)** - Fix the square printing function that doesn't respect the size parameter
3. **Sort (Ruby)** - Fix the sorting algorithm that doesn't sort arguments properly
4. **User Password (Python)** - Fix the User class password validation that currently fails tests
5. **Double Linked List (C)** - Fix the delete function in the double linked list implementation

## Requirements

- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files must end with a new line
- All code will be tested on the specified platform

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the challenge directory
3. Read each task description carefully
4. Fix the bugs in each file
5. Test your solutions

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: FizzBuzz
Fix the Python FizzBuzz implementation that incorrectly prints "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

### Task 1: Print Square
Fix the JavaScript function that prints squares of incorrect size.

### Task 2: Sort
Fix the Ruby sorting algorithm that doesn't properly sort command line arguments.

### Task 3: User Password
Fix the Python User class that fails password validation tests.

### Task 4: Double Linked List
Fix the C implementation of a double linked list delete function that corrupts the list structure.

## Testing

Each task includes expected output examples. Make sure your fixed code produces the correct output as shown in the task descriptions.
