# Holberton School - Fix My Code Challenge

This repository contains a collection of debugging challenges across multiple programming languages. Students are tasked with identifying and fixing bugs in pre-written code implementations.

## Project Overview

The Fix My Code Challenge is designed to test debugging skills and understanding of different programming concepts across Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and C. Each challenge presents a common programming problem with intentional bugs that need to be identified and corrected.

## Challenges Included

The repository contains debugging exercises in the `/challenge` directory:

- **Python**: FizzBuzz implementation bug
- **JavaScript**: Square printing function issue  
- **Ruby**: Argument sorting problem
- **Python**: User class password validation error
- **C**: Double linked list delete function corruption

## Requirements

- All files must be compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Code should be compiled/executed successfully after fixes
- All files must end with a new line
- Use only allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the `/challenge` directory
3. Read the task descriptions for each challenge
4. Fix the bugs in each implementation
5. Test your solutions against the expected outputs

## Skills Practiced

- **Debugging**: Identifying logical errors in existing code
- **Code Analysis**: Understanding existing codebases across languages
- **Testing**: Verifying fixes against expected outputs
- **Multi-language Programming**: Working with Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and C
